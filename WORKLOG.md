# WORKLOG — Riskill Cinematic
## 2025-08-09 — Stack Explorer Sprint 1 — UI/UX skeleton
### Completed
- Implemented segmented progress tracker (5 steps) with subtle glow/scale on active in `src/components/revx/StackCarousel.tsx`.
- Added directional slide transitions (left/right) via Framer Motion with fade and ease; preserves arrow keys + swipe.
- Introduced agent pulse avatar (idle breathing glow) anchored in overlay corner; color-coded per stage (blue/purple/amber/emerald).
- Built placeholder modules: anonymized transactions list, JSON snippet scroller, OCR tile, and animated number ticker for synthesis.
- Reserved persistent AgentBubble slot (sticky panel) to avoid layout shifts during transitions.
- Ensured responsive grid layout (content + side slot) and correct z-index layering within `src/components/revx/FocusOverlay.tsx` (overlay `z-50`, avatar `z-20`, header `z-10`).
- No copy or backend integration included; placeholders only per scope.

### Acceptance Trace
- Progress lights animate on stage change.
- Slides transition with directional meaning; smooth storyboard feel.
- Agent avatar/pulse continuously animates.
- Placeholder data animates in; numbers tick to target.
- Layout clean on mobile/tablet/desktop; no collisions.
- Panels/windows stack correctly above the glass background.

### Next Steps
- Hook telemetry `onSlideChange` to analytics once narrative is added.
- Expand placeholders with richer visuals (icons, microflows) while staying performant.

## 2025-08-09 — Revenue revx Step 1 (AgentBubble + FocusOverlay skeleton)
### Completed
- Added feature flag hook `src/hooks/useFeatureFlag.ts` (gate: `?revx=1`).
- Created `src/components/revx/AgentBubble.tsx` (narrative bubble with "Learn more").
- Created `src/components/revx/FocusOverlay.tsx` (portal modal with scroll lock, background inert, focus trap, ESC, focus-restore).
- Created `src/components/revx/StackCarousel.tsx` (placeholder slides; arrow keys + swipe; slide bars).
- Created minimal telemetry util `src/utils/telemetry.ts` with sampling.
- Integrated into `src/widgets/RevenuePulse.tsx` behind flag: hotspot button, collision-aware bubble, outside-click dismiss, and overlay with carousel.
- Emitted events: `revx.bubble_open`, `revx.learn_more`, `revx.overlay_open`, `revx.slide_change`, `revx.overlay_close`.
- Replaced emoji hotspot with a minimalist inline SVG (layers); added `aria-expanded` to reflect state.
- Kept background JPEG-only for this pass; overlays opt-in via `?bg=overlay` unchanged.

### Decisions
- Transform/opacity-only animations (160–220 ms, ease [0.2, 0.8, 0.2, 1]); respect `prefers-reduced-motion`.
- Blur gated off by default in overlay (mobile jank avoidance); opacity-dim fallback retained.
- Maintain CardWidget semantics (`role="button"`) and stopPropagation on inner actions.
- Mobile-first behavior: bubble toggles on tap; dismiss on outside/ESC; width clamped.

### Next Steps
- Polish copy, add icons, and refine density for compact buckets.
- Add deeper slide content and progress indicators; consider lazy-loading assets.
- QA per checklist: keyboard path, mobile tap+swipe, 360/768/1440/1920 visuals, no console warnings, CLS ~0.
- After local QA, push and redeploy; validate at https://riskill-zones-glass.windsurf.build/?revx=1 and share with Joe.

### Notes
- If Vite shows "Outdated Optimize Dep" (504), stop dev server, delete `riskill-cinematic/node_modules/.vite`, and restart dev.
## 2025-08-09 — Top Widgets polish + propagation fix
### Completed
- Added `event.stopPropagation()` in `src/widgets/QuickAction.tsx` to prevent parent `onPrimaryAction` from firing when quick actions are clicked.
- Applied responsive density tuning with `useResizeDensity` to:
  - `src/widgets/OpsHealth.tsx`
  - `src/widgets/RiskAlerts.tsx`
  - `src/widgets/AgentActivity.tsx`
  Adjusted typography (`text-[]` buckets), meters, and indicator sizes per breakpoint.
- Audited nested button issue: `CardWidget` now uses `motion.div` with `role="button"`; no remaining `motion.button` instances found. QuickAction buttons are safe within a role-based wrapper.
- Kept background at JPEG-only for stability; prepared CSS for future WebP but reverted until asset exists.

### Decisions
- Maintain accessibility: `role="button"` + keyboard handlers on interactive `CardWidget`; focus ring via `group-focus-within`.
- Micro-interactions remain transform/opacity only; preserve reduced-motion guard.

### Next Steps
- Optional: create `public/assets/bg/nature-vista-dark.webp` and re-introduce `image-set()` fallback in CSS.
- Run dev server at http://localhost:5178; verify no hydration warnings; QA responsive (360/768/1440/1920) + Lighthouse mobile ≥85.
- If clean, push and redeploy; validate live and share preview to Joe.


## 2025-08-08 — Doc alignment for cinematic intro
- Completed:
  - Added “Intro Scene Technical & Narrative Spec” and “Windsurf Boot‑Up Prompt” to `PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md`.
  - Added “Windsurf Persistent Self‑Alignment Prompt — Visual Compass” to `PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md`.
  - Added “Visual Compass & Libraries” section to `README.md`.
- Decisions:
  - Visual compass: glassmorphism, depth layering, minimalist enterprise typography (Inter/Manrope/IBM Plex Sans), dark neutrals + teal/blue/mint accent.
  - Preferred libraries: framer‑motion (primary), GSAP (timelines as needed), three.js + react‑three‑fiber (+ postprocessing sparingly), echarts or D3/visx, TailwindCSS + shadcn/ui.
  - Desktop‑first (16:9), transform/opacity‑only motion; micro 160–220 ms, section 650–800 ms, easing (0.2, 0.8, 0.2, 1).
- Next Steps:
  - Phase 1 cinematic baseline: implement glassmorphic layout (Left/Center/Right panels) and Framer Motion sequences for S0–S3.
  - Optional stack enablement (progressive): TailwindCSS setup + Inter font; evaluate echarts vs. visx for first animated insight; defer GSAP/three.js until needed.
  - Maintain preview cadence at http://localhost:5178; append WORKLOG upon each change.

## 2025-08-08 — Phase 1 S0–S3 implemented
- Completed:
  - Implemented S0–S3 in `riskill-cinematic/src/scenes/intro/IntroOrchestrator.tsx` using Framer Motion:
    - S0: initial fade-in background gradient.
    - S1: abstract data network (SVG points + links) animates in.
    - S2: “INSIGHT DETECTED” badge (Move37 cue) appears.
    - S3: onboarding panel slides in with role input.
  - Added visible “Skip Intro” button (focusable; a11y label) to jump to S3.
  - Updated `riskill-cinematic/src/App.tsx` to render `IntroOrchestrator` as main view.
- Decisions:
  - Framer-only for Phase 1 (no Tailwind/GSAP/three yet) to keep footprint minimal.
  - Deterministic mini-network for performance; no external viz lib yet.
- Next Steps:
  - Add prefers-reduced-motion handling for motion tokens.
  - Introduce glassmorphic panels (CSS) to begin visual compass alignment.
  - Prepare CTA handoff path to `AdaptiveConsole` and stage controls.
  - Evaluate charts stack (echarts vs. visx) for first animated insight.

## 2025-08-09 — Zones-only CardWidget micro-app baseline
### Completed
- Implemented CardWidget, QuickAction, useResizeDensity, and bus; all widgets scaffolded with mock UIs.
- Wired zones to widgets (`TopWidgets.tsx`, `LeftZone.tsx`, `MiddleCanvas.tsx`, `RightZone.tsx`).
- Fixed TypeScript type-only imports and bus unsubscribe cleanup.
- Updated `PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md` with CardWidget Micro-App Spec and checklist; updated `README.md`; added `plan.md` with doc-driven workflow.
### Decisions
- Adopt doc-driven workflow with authoritative docs at repo root: `PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md`, `README.md`, `WORKLOG.md`.
- Quick actions always visible at ≤480px; hover/focus on larger screens.
- Transform/opacity-only animations; respect prefers-reduced-motion.
- Use lightweight in-memory event bus initially.
### Next Steps
- Apply dark nature vista background with overlay gradient (ensure AA contrast).
- Validate responsiveness (360/768/1440–1920), a11y (focus-visible, hit targets), and perf.
- Begin density tuning via `useResizeDensity`; expand/document bus topics.

## 2025-08-09 — Background + Density + Event Topics
### Completed
- Implemented dark nature vista background with overlay gradients via `.bg-onyx-vista`; added `src/theme/bg.ts` helper.
- Added mobile perf guard (`background-attachment: scroll` ≤480px); eager-loaded bg image stub.
- Wired actionable density buckets into `RevenuePulse`, `CommandCanvasCard`, and `RecommendationsCard` (padding/typography/subtitle rules).
- Stabilized widget event topics and documented in `PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md` and `README.md`.
- Added assets placeholder `public/assets/bg/README.txt` with guidance.
### Decisions
- Keep in-memory `bus.ts` for now; plan a future event bridge with persistence/audit.
- Maintain quick actions always visible at ≤480px; motion is transform/opacity only.
- QA gates are blocking: responsive set, mobile perf (Lighthouse ≥85), a11y checks, and bus behavior.
### Next Steps
- Add optimized `nature-vista-dark.jpg` (or WebP) to `public/assets/bg/` per guidance.
- Run dev server, validate 360/768/1440/1920 screenshots, and capture Lighthouse mobile perf.
- Post preview URL after compile-green; iterate on contrast/density if needed.

## 2025-08-09 — GitHub Push + Windsurf Deploy Kickoff
### Completed
- Created root `.gitignore` to ignore node_modules/dist/logs.
- Committed and pushed changes to `origin/main` (zones-only background, density wiring, event topics, docs, netlify.toml).
- Created `netlify.toml` for Vite SPA build/preview and SPA redirects.
- Initiated Windsurf deploy → Netlify with subdomain `riskill-zones-glass`.
### Metadata
- Windsurf Deployment ID: `a06b0cba-a9bf-4bfc-a4f9-2dc44b9b2620`.
- Project ID: `f30c7c0e-885a-45af-a2e0-b49512827417`.
- Pending URL: https://riskill-zones-glass.windsurf.build
### Next Steps
- Wait for build to complete; claim site in UI to view logs if needed.
- After live, run QA gates on deployed build (responsive/perf/a11y/behavior).

## 2025-08-09 — Savepoint Reboot Prompt
### Completed
- Created a comprehensive reboot prompt savepoint for rolodexterVS and Joe.
- Path: `notes/savepoints/2025-08-09/savepoint-2025-08-09-1855.md`.
### Next Steps
- Commit and push savepoint to GitHub for persistence.

## 2025-08-09 — Background asset installed (Starry Night)
### Completed
- Downloaded Pexels starry night image to `riskill-cinematic/public/assets/bg/nature-vista-dark.jpg` (~122 KB, 1920×1080 via Pexels compression params).
- Verified rendering under `.bg-onyx-vista` overlays in local preview at `http://localhost:5178`.
### Decisions
- Keep JPG for now for speed; consider converting to WebP once QA is green.
### Next Steps
- Optionally convert to WebP and point `src/theme/bg.ts` `BG_URL` to `nature-vista-dark.webp`.
- Run responsive checks (360/768/1440/1920) and Lighthouse mobile ≥85 with background enabled.
- Claim Netlify site to view logs and proceed with deployed QA gates.

## 2025-08-09 — Backdrop z-index fix for background visibility
### Completed
- Adjusted `GradientBackdrop` container from `-z-10` to `z-0` and added `pointer-events-none` so `.bg-onyx-vista` renders above the body gradient while staying below app content.
### Rationale
- Negative z-index placed the fixed backdrop behind the page background, making the image imperceptible despite correct asset path.
### Next Steps
- Verify on http://localhost:5178 after hard refresh (disable cache). If still subtle, temporarily reduce overlay alpha in `.bg-onyx-vista` for validation, then revert.

## 2025-08-09 — Background default visibility + nested button fix
### Completed
- Made raw background the default (`bg-onyx-vista-raw`), overlays now opt-in via `?bg=overlay` or `#bg=overlay`.
- Softened overlay opacities in `src/index.css` to maintain legibility when overlays are enabled.
- Fixed React warning by replacing outer `motion.button` with `motion.div` (role="button" + keyboard handlers) in `src/widgets/CardWidget.tsx` to avoid nested `<button>`.
### Result
- Background clearly visible by default at http://localhost:5178/; console warning resolved.
### Next Steps
- Commit and push; redeploy via Windsurf→Netlify and validate live.
