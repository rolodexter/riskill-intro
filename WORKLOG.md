# WORKLOG — Riskill Cinematic

## 2025-08-08 — Doc alignment for cinematic intro
- Completed:
  - Added “Intro Scene Technical & Narrative Spec” and “Windsurf Boot‑Up Prompt” to `PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md`.
  - Added “Windsurf Persistent Self‑Alignment Prompt — Visual Compass” to `PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md`.
  - Added “Visual Compass & Libraries” section to `README.md`.
- Decisions:
  - Visual compass: glassmorphism, depth layering, minimalist enterprise typography (Inter/Manrope/IBM Plex Sans), dark neutrals + teal/blue/mint accent.
  - Preferred libraries: framer‑motion (primary), GSAP (timelines as needed), three.js + react‑three‑fiber (+ postprocessing sparingly), echarts or D3/visx, TailwindCSS + shadcn/ui.
  - Desktop‑first (16:9), transform/opacity‑only motion; micro 160–220 ms, section 650–800 ms, easing (0.2, 0.8, 0.2, 1).
- Next Steps:
  - Phase 1 cinematic baseline: implement glassmorphic layout (Left/Center/Right panels) and Framer Motion sequences for S0–S3.
  - Optional stack enablement (progressive): TailwindCSS setup + Inter font; evaluate echarts vs. visx for first animated insight; defer GSAP/three.js until needed.
  - Maintain preview cadence at http://localhost:5178; append WORKLOG upon each change.

## 2025-08-08 — Phase 1 S0–S3 implemented
- Completed:
  - Implemented S0–S3 in `riskill-cinematic/src/scenes/intro/IntroOrchestrator.tsx` using Framer Motion:
    - S0: initial fade-in background gradient.
    - S1: abstract data network (SVG points + links) animates in.
    - S2: “INSIGHT DETECTED” badge (Move37 cue) appears.
    - S3: onboarding panel slides in with role input.
  - Added visible “Skip Intro” button (focusable; a11y label) to jump to S3.
  - Updated `riskill-cinematic/src/App.tsx` to render `IntroOrchestrator` as main view.
- Decisions:
  - Framer-only for Phase 1 (no Tailwind/GSAP/three yet) to keep footprint minimal.
  - Deterministic mini-network for performance; no external viz lib yet.
- Next Steps:
  - Add prefers-reduced-motion handling for motion tokens.
  - Introduce glassmorphic panels (CSS) to begin visual compass alignment.
  - Prepare CTA handoff path to `AdaptiveConsole` and stage controls.
  - Evaluate charts stack (echarts vs. visx) for first animated insight.

## 2025-08-09 — Zones-only CardWidget micro-app baseline
### Completed
- Implemented CardWidget, QuickAction, useResizeDensity, and bus; all widgets scaffolded with mock UIs.
- Wired zones to widgets (`TopWidgets.tsx`, `LeftZone.tsx`, `MiddleCanvas.tsx`, `RightZone.tsx`).
- Fixed TypeScript type-only imports and bus unsubscribe cleanup.
- Updated `PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md` with CardWidget Micro-App Spec and checklist; updated `README.md`; added `plan.md` with doc-driven workflow.
### Decisions
- Adopt doc-driven workflow with authoritative docs at repo root: `PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md`, `README.md`, `WORKLOG.md`.
- Quick actions always visible at ≤480px; hover/focus on larger screens.
- Transform/opacity-only animations; respect prefers-reduced-motion.
- Use lightweight in-memory event bus initially.
### Next Steps
- Apply dark nature vista background with overlay gradient (ensure AA contrast).
- Validate responsiveness (360/768/1440–1920), a11y (focus-visible, hit targets), and perf.
- Begin density tuning via `useResizeDensity`; expand/document bus topics.

## 2025-08-09 — Background + Density + Event Topics
### Completed
- Implemented dark nature vista background with overlay gradients via `.bg-onyx-vista`; added `src/theme/bg.ts` helper.
- Added mobile perf guard (`background-attachment: scroll` ≤480px); eager-loaded bg image stub.
- Wired actionable density buckets into `RevenuePulse`, `CommandCanvasCard`, and `RecommendationsCard` (padding/typography/subtitle rules).
- Stabilized widget event topics and documented in `PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md` and `README.md`.
- Added assets placeholder `public/assets/bg/README.txt` with guidance.
### Decisions
- Keep in-memory `bus.ts` for now; plan a future event bridge with persistence/audit.
- Maintain quick actions always visible at ≤480px; motion is transform/opacity only.
- QA gates are blocking: responsive set, mobile perf (Lighthouse ≥85), a11y checks, and bus behavior.
### Next Steps
- Add optimized `nature-vista-dark.jpg` (or WebP) to `public/assets/bg/` per guidance.
- Run dev server, validate 360/768/1440/1920 screenshots, and capture Lighthouse mobile perf.
- Post preview URL after compile-green; iterate on contrast/density if needed.
