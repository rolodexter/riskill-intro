# Technical-to-Strategic Reboot Prompt for rolodexterGPT

Date: 2025-08-10
Repository: C:\Users\rolod\OneDrive\riskill-intro
Project: riskill-cinematic
Live URL: https://riskill-zones-glass.windsurf.build/?revx=1
Deployment: Windsurf/Netlify (ProjectId f30c7c0e-885a-45af-a2e0-b49512827417, subdomain riskill-zones-glass), config at `riskill-cinematic/windsurf_deployment.yaml`

---

## 1) Implementation summary and technical achievements

- __KPI widget UX refactor (phase focus: RevenuePulse)__
  - Implemented executive-grade Z-stack animation in `src/widgets/RevenuePulse.tsx`.
  - Next card sits behind at ~0.97 scale with ~0.85 opacity; subtle vertical offsets; depth-based shadow.
  - Transitions use transform + opacity only with cubic-bezier(0.2,0.8,0.2,1); respects `prefers-reduced-motion` (crossfade-only fallback).
  - All motion confined within fixed widget dimensions; no layout shifts.

- __Progressive disclosure to contextual chat__
  - `useProgressiveDisclosure.escalateToChat()` emits `progressive.open` with full context including `anchorRect` and optional `narrative`.
  - `src/components/chat/ChatWindow.tsx` now renders a narrative text block above metric tiles and anchors adjacent to the invoking widget.
  - Desktop: anchored dialog near widget; Mobile (≤640px): bottom-sheet fallback; A11y: role="dialog", aria-modal, ESC close, focus trap & restore.

- __Interaction model alignment__
  - Click/tap-only escalation enforced; keyboard Enter/Space disabled for cards via `CardWidget` configuration.
  - Hover affords subtle lift only (no escalation), maintaining intent clarity.

- __Content and icons__
  - Centralized KPI content in `src/content/kpi.ts` with narrative fields for chat expansion.
  - Shared KPI icon set (`src/components/icons/KPI.tsx`) cleaned; removed unused import to resolve TS6133.

- __Build and deploy__
  - TypeScript and Vite build verified locally; successful Windsurf/Netlify deployment to `riskill-zones-glass`.
  - Docs updated in `WORKLOG.md`; project structure/README touched to reflect current state.

- __Technical challenges & solutions__
  - Anchored dialog placement: used widget `getBoundingClientRect()` with smart fallback left/right/below to avoid viewport clipping.
  - Fixed-size widget discipline: enforced `overflow-hidden` in the content well; animations stay within bounds to prevent jank.
  - Animation/perf: restricted to GPU-friendly transforms and opacity; tuned durations to keep motion subtle and responsive.
  - TS lint noise: removed unused React import in `src/components/icons/KPI.tsx` to fix TS6133.

- __Performance observations__
  - Smooth 60fps feel in dev on modern hardware; no layout shifts observed during card transitions.
  - Reduced-motion path verified (crossfade-only) with no scale/translate.

- __Testing outcomes__
  - Local smoke QA across desktop and narrow viewport: animation, anchoring, bottom-sheet fallback, focus behaviors passed.
  - Console clean in smoke runs; telemetry logs active; no runtime errors noted.
  - Deployed build loads with `?revx=1` flag; basic navigation stable.

## 2) Strategic insights and business implications

- __What worked better than expected__
  - Anchored chat near the source widget maintains spatial continuity, improving trust and comprehension.
  - Transform/opacity-only strategy yields premium motion without layout instability.

- __What underperformed or needs tuning__
  - Small-screen density: narrative length can crowd content; may require truncation rules or “Read more”.
  - Edge anchoring cases in complex grid layouts warrant additional placement heuristics and collision buffers.

- __New opportunities enabled__
  - KPI-specific narratives unlock lightweight storytelling in-product without page transitions.
  - Event-bus based disclosure (`progressive.open`) enables any widget/module to escalate contextually.

- __Potential pivots/constraints__
  - Strict click/tap-only escalation reduces accidental opens but may slow keyboard-first workflows; consider targeted keyboard affordances outside cards.
  - Consistent fixed-height widget discipline may limit extremely rich micro-viz; offload detail to chat pane.

---

## 3) Documentation requirements and communication needs

- __Technical specs to update__
  - Add/confirm `ProgressiveContext` fields (title, primary, metrics, anchorRect, narrative) in `src/hooks/useProgressiveDisclosure.ts` docs.
  - Record animation timings, easing, depth offsets, and reduced-motion behavior in a motion spec section.

- __User guidance / training__
  - Add a short “How to read KPI cards” and “How to open details” guide in README or in-app help.
  - Document mobile bottom-sheet behavior and accessibility shortcuts (ESC to close, focus restoration).

- __API/integration docs__
  - Mini integration guide: “How to make any widget escalate to chat,” with code snippet for `escalateToChat(ctx)` and anchorRect capture.
  - Content model guidance for adding `narrative` per KPI in `src/content/kpi.ts`.

- __Process improvements__
  - Continue Save Point notes per cut under `notes/savepoints/`.
  - Maintain WORKLOG entries per feature slice; include QA checklist outcomes and any regressions.

## 4) Stakeholder context and feedback integration

- __Stakeholder feedback__
  - No blocking feedback recorded during this cut. Visual polish and narrative extension were the focus.

- __Integration points__
  - Telemetry hooks in `src/utils/telemetry.ts` for interaction tracking.
  - Framer Motion for transitions; Tailwind utility classes for layout/appearance.
  - Event bus `src/widgets/bus.ts` with `progressive.open` topic used by ChatWindow.

- __Communication & approvals__
  - Deployment succeeded to Windsurf/Netlify; site is currently unclaimed in Netlify. Claiming enables detailed deploy logs and settings.

---

## 5) Strategic guidance requests and next priorities

- __Decisions needed__
  - Narrative length policy (truncate vs. expandable) and tone guidelines for KPI stories.
  - Keyboard affordances: keep click/tap-only, or add explicit keyboard trigger outside the card surface?
  - Anchoring heuristics: finalize placement priorities and collision margins for edge cases.

- __Next priorities__
  - Full QA: desktop + mobile, reduced-motion, keyboard nav, hit target sizes, and scroll interactions.
  - Lighthouse and accessibility audit; address contrast, semantics, and motion preferences.
  - Extend/polish remaining KPIs (OpsHealth, RiskAlerts, AgentActivity) to the finalized icon+text+context spec and narrative quality bar.
  - Add micro-viz consistency pass (sparkline scales, colors, empty states).
  - Authoritize docs: update `README.md`, `PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md`, and `WORKLOG.md` with the final interaction model and motion spec.

- __Stakeholder updates__
  - Prepare a short demo script showing: card hover, card rotation, click escalation, anchored chat, mobile bottom-sheet.
  - Share deployment URL and feature flag `?revx=1` for review.

This prompt is intended to allow rolodexterGPT to immediately assume strategic leadership for the next phase: finalize the KPI UX refactor across all widgets, institutionalize the narrative/chat pattern, complete QA and audits, and coordinate stakeholder review and sign-off.
