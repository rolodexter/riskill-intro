## 1) Implementation summary and technical achievements

- **Architecture shift:** Replaced cinematic intro with a zones-only, glassmorphic dashboard of independent CardWidgets (micro-apps). No routing; single-page skeleton.
- **Core components created:**
  - `src/widgets/CardWidget.tsx` — interactive card shell (hover lift/glow, press compress, focus-visible ring, quick actions, mobile fallback at ≤480px).
  - `src/widgets/QuickAction.tsx` — accessible quick action button (>= 40×40 hit targets).
  - `src/widgets/useResizeDensity.ts` — ResizeObserver-driven density hook (xs/sm/md/lg buckets) for responsive tuning.
  - `src/widgets/bus.ts` — lightweight in-memory pub/sub event bus (with proper effect-safe unsubscribe).
- **Widgets scaffolded (all mock UIs ready):**
  - Top row: `RevenuePulse`, `OpsHealth`, `RiskAlerts`, `AgentActivity`.
  - Left zone: `NavigationCard`, `FiltersCard`, `DataSourcesCard`.
  - Middle zone: `CommandCanvasCard`, `InsightStreamCard`, `ActionQueueCard`.
  - Right zone: `RecommendationsCard`, `AlertsCard`, `CtaCard`.
- **Event bus demo implemented:** `RecommendationsCard` publishes `action.queue.push`; `ActionQueueCard` subscribes and appends items.
- **Zones wired:**
  - `TopWidgets.tsx`, `LeftZone.tsx`, `MiddleCanvas.tsx`, `RightZone.tsx` now render the widgets instead of placeholders.
- **Tooling and config fixes:**
  - Tailwind v4/PostCSS plugin error resolved by installing and using `@tailwindcss/postcss`.
  - TypeScript strict import fix: type-only imports for `ReactNode`.
  - Bus unsubscribe returns `void` to satisfy React effect cleanup.
- **Docs aligned with doc-driven workflow:**
  - `PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md`: Added “Zones-Only Dashboard — CardWidget Micro-App Spec,” grid/zone map, contract, motion/A11y policies, checklist.
  - `README.md`: Retitled to zones-only dashboard, updated stack/troubleshooting, added Recent Updates and historical context.
  - `plan.md`: Persisted doc-driven workflow rules and pasteable prompt.

### Technical challenges encountered and solutions
- **Tailwind v4/PostCSS error (build-time):** fixed by adding `@tailwindcss/postcss` and updating PostCSS config.
- **TypeScript `verbatimModuleSyntax`:** changed `ReactNode` imports to type-only.
- **Effect cleanup type mismatch:** ensured `bus.sub` returns a `void` cleanup.

### Performance metrics and optimization results
- Current status: no formal metrics captured yet.
- Design choices already made for perf: transform/opacity-only animations; hover/press micro-interactions; quick actions visibility optimized for mobile.
- Target: 60 fps on modern desktop; acceptable on older iPhones with reduced motion. Perf validation pending after background image and density tuning.

### Testing outcomes and user feedback
- Manual smoke tests during development; no automated tests yet.
- Event bus behavior verified via Recommendations → ActionQueue demo.
- Stakeholder preference captured: proactive preview pings with URL after meaningful changes.

## 2) Strategic insights and business implications

- **Micro-app architecture enables:** parallel development of cards, independent lifecycle, and selective loading in future. Facilitates A/B testing at the card level.
- **Inter-widget bus unlocks:** cross-card orchestration (e.g., recommendations driving queued actions). Paves path for centralized action log and auditability.
- **Accessibility-first interactions:** keyboard focus-visible rings and adequate hit targets improve enterprise usability and compliance posture.
- **Limitations discovered:** current bus is in-memory only (no persistence, no cross-tab). Background visual not yet implemented; density rules exist but not applied per-card.
- **Opportunity:** background with gradient overlay + density tuning can elevate perceived quality without heavy CPU/GPU cost.

---

## 3) Documentation requirements and communication needs

- **Technical specifications to update/maintain:**
  - Keep `PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md` checklist in sync (mark background + density when done).
  - Document event topics and payload schemas in `src/widgets/bus.ts` and mirror in docs.
- **User guidance/training:**
  - Add a short “Using the Dashboard” section to `README.md` (navigating zones, quick actions, keyboard usage).
- **API/integration guides:**
  - Draft an event schema guide for future backend/event-bridge integration.
- **Process improvements:**
  - Enforce doc-driven workflow: docs first -> code -> WORKLOG entry -> preview post.

---

## 4) Stakeholder context and feedback integration

- **Stakeholder preferences:** proactive pings with live preview URL after meaningful UI/routing changes.
- **Coordination:** no external teams integrated yet; all work local to `riskill-cinematic` package.
- **Integration points (future):** event bridge for recommendations/actions; persisted action log service.
- **Communication patterns:** maintain Recent Updates in `README.md` and WORKLOG entries per change using the provided template.

## 5) Strategic guidance requests and next priorities

### Decisions needed
- Approve background art direction: dark nature vista + overlay gradient (asset selection and licensing).
- Confirm event topics to stabilize a cross-widget contract (e.g., `action.queue.push`, `insight.highlight`, `filters.apply`).
- Decide whether to keep the in-memory bus short-term or introduce a simple event bridge/persistence.

### Near-term priorities
- Implement background image with gradient overlay; ensure AA contrast.
- Apply `useResizeDensity` in selected widgets for typographic/padding adjustments.
- Start dev server and validate:
  - 25/50/25 desktop columns and mobile stacking order.
  - Responsiveness at 360, 768, 1440–1920 widths.
  - A11y (focus-visible, hit targets) and reduced-motion behavior.
  - Perf (basic FPS observation; look for layout thrash).
- Append WORKLOG entry for this milestone (template below) and post preview URL.

### WORKLOG entry template (for this milestone)
```
## 2025-08-09 — Zones-only CardWidget micro-app baseline
### Completed
- Implemented CardWidget, QuickAction, useResizeDensity, and bus; all widgets scaffolded with mock UIs.
- Wired zones to widgets (TopWidgets, LeftZone, MiddleCanvas, RightZone).
- Fixed TS type-only imports and bus unsubscribe cleanup.
- Updated PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md and README.md; added plan.md with doc-driven workflow.
### Decisions
- Adopt doc-driven workflow with authoritative docs at repo root.
- Quick actions always visible at ≤480px; hover/focus on larger screens.
- Transform/opacity-only animations; respect prefers-reduced-motion.
- Use lightweight in-memory event bus initially.
### Next Steps
- Apply dark nature vista background with overlay gradient.
- Validate responsiveness, a11y, and perf; publish preview URL.
- Start density tuning via useResizeDensity; expand bus topics.
```

### How to resume (rolodexterGPT)
- Read `C:\Users\rolod\OneDrive\riskill-intro\plan.md` and the authoritative docs:
  - `PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md`, `README.md`, `WORKLOG.md` (update docs first if drifted).
- Run dev server (Windows PowerShell):
  ```powershell
  cd "C:\Users\rolod\OneDrive\riskill-intro\riskill-cinematic";
  npm install; npm run dev -- --host localhost --port 5178 --strictPort
  ```
- Validate grid and interactions; then continue with background + density tasks and append WORKLOG using the provided template.
