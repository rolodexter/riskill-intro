# Technical-to-Strategic Reboot Prompt — riskill-cinematic (ChatWindow GlassCard + Overlay Anchor)

This prompt transfers full implementation context to rolodexterGPT for seamless handback and next-phase planning.

## 1) Implementation summary and technical achievements

- __Core features implemented__
  - `src/App.tsx`: Added `#dashboard-overlay` inside `<main>` grid container; `pointer-events-none`, `position: absolute`, `z-90` for anchoring ChatWindow. Root stacking context isolated for Z‑order.
  - `src/components/chat/ChatWindow.tsx`: Portaled into overlay via `createPortal`; switched from fixed to absolute positioning relative to overlay; rAF-batched re-anchoring on scroll/resize/`ResizeObserver` with collision handling (prefer right, flip left, fallback center/below; clamped to overlay bounds).
  - Mobile bottom sheet style (≤640px) with keyboard safe area using `visualViewport` and footer `pb: env(safe-area-inset-bottom)`.
  - Pointer-events hygiene: overlay root `pointer-events-none`, ChatWindow portal root `pointer-events-auto` (single wrapper) to constrain hit-testing to chat only.
  - Accessibility: preserved dialog semantics, focus behaviors, ESC close; `aria-describedby` links to narrative region.
  - Frameless GlassCard restyle: removed visible border; `bg-white/6–8`, `backdrop-blur-lg`, `ring-1 ring-white/[0.02]`, stronger elevation shadow; unified paddings/typography; shared button/input styles; scroller `overscroll-contain`.
- __Technical challenges + solutions__
  - Anchoring inside grid container: solved with in-grid overlay portal and absolute positioning; collision detection with 16px margins.
  - Hit-testing leakage: resolved by pointer-events pattern (root none, portal auto).
  - Resize/layout thrash: mitigated with rAF batching and will-change; avoided layout-affecting animations (transform/opacity only).
  - TS lint issue on `ResizeObserver` optionality: fixed.
  - Provider deploy flakiness on existing ProjectId: worked around by creating a fresh Windsurf site; saved new project metadata.
- __Build and bundle__
  - Tooling: Vite + React + TypeScript + Tailwind + Framer Motion.
  - Production build: success in ~5.05s.
  - Bundle artifacts (gzip): CSS ~8.68 kB; JS ~112.80 kB.
- __Performance__
  - Animations limited to transform/opacity; no CLS observed during QA; 60fps target met in local tests.
  - Overlay is non-interactive except chat subtree; reduced event overhead.
- __Testing outcomes & feedback__
  - Desktop/mobile QA pass including reduced motion; a11y semantics intact.
  - User UX review: “looks fine now” for frameless glass styling and widget parity.
  - Lighthouse/axe: pending (to run and record).
  - Console: clean during local runs; no runtime errors observed.

```

## 2) Strategic insights and business implications

- __What worked better__
  - In-grid overlay anchoring makes chat feel contextual to widgets; blends with dashboard Z‑stack, improving perceived integration and trust.
  - Frameless GlassCard increases visual polish and parity with other widgets; lower visual weight yields clearer focus on content.
- __What needs attention__
  - Anchoring edge cases on extreme container sizes and long narratives; may need smarter heuristics (e.g., side preference by free space map), and mutation observers for content growth.
  - Keyboard affordances “outside cards” remain a UX decision area (focus escape, global shortcuts).
- __Enablers__
  - Established overlay/portal pattern unlocks future overlays (tooltips, menus, scrims) with robust pointer event control.
  - Shared control styles (buttons, inputs) provide a baseline for scalable widget library.
- __Limitations / risks__
  - Provider deployment reliability with existing site IDs was inconsistent; new site is a stable workaround but adds environment sprawl until consolidated.
  - Narrative length policy undefined; could affect layout stability and scroll behaviors; requires product guidance.

## 3) Documentation requirements and communication needs

- __Technical specs to update__
  - `PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md`: add overlay portal design, `#dashboard-overlay` rationale, pointer-events model, and anchoring algorithm summary.
  - `README.md`: local dev/QA steps; reduced-motion testing; deployment notes (Windsurf site and Netlify SPA config).
  - `WORKLOG.md`: entries added for overlay anchoring and frameless GlassCard; continue appending QA/audit results.
- __Guides__
  - A11y checklist for overlays/dialogs (roles, traps, escape, aria links, reduced motion).
  - Integration guide: how widgets provide `anchorRect` to the chat trigger; recommended hit-target sizes.
  - Visual tokens: glass surfaces, rings, shadows, z‑tiers; Tailwind token table mapping.
- __API/Events__
  - If using `widgets/bus.ts` or similar, document relevant events for opening chat with context.
- __Process improvements__
  - Add npm scripts for Lighthouse/axe runs and report capture; include CI job for basic audits.

## 4) Stakeholder context and feedback integration

- __Stakeholders__
  - Design: approved frameless glass and widget parity.
  - Product: approved chat integration approach; outstanding decisions on narrative length and keyboard affordances.
  - QA: manual pass OK; automated audits pending.
- __Deployments__
  - New Windsurf site created to bypass provider error on original project ID.
  - Claim site in Netlify via Windsurf step UI to view build logs and manage env.
- __Communication patterns__
  - Proactive notifications after meaningful UI changes with preview URL were requested and followed.

## 5) Strategic guidance requests and next priorities

- __Decisions needed__
  - Narrative length policy (truncate vs. scroll-first, read-more affordance, max lines on desktop/mobile).
  - Keyboard affordances outside cards (global shortcut to reopen, focus traversal model, escape behaviors when nested).
  - Whether to consolidate deployment back to the original site ID or keep the new review subdomain.
- __Immediate next steps__
  - Run Lighthouse and axe; record results; fix critical a11y/perf opportunities.
  - Finalize anchoring heuristics for edge cases; consider transform-only placement updates to avoid any layout writes post-initial.
  - Tokenize z-index tiers and surface colors in Tailwind; align micro-viz chrome across KPI cards.
  - Update README/PROJECT_STRUCTURE with the overlay pattern and control styles; append WORKLOG with audit results and redeploy notes.
  - Prepare a short demo script for stakeholder review.
