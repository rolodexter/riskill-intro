# Save Point — Conversation Reboot Prompt (rolodexterVS + Joe)

Time: 2025-08-10T21:29:29-07:00
Workspace: `c:/Users/rolod/OneDrive/riskill-intro/riskill-cinematic`
Live preview: https://riskill-chat-overlay.windsurf.build

Use this as the first message in a new session to restore full continuity for rolodexterVS and Joe.

## 1) Implementation summary and technical achievements

- **Disclosure tooltip clipping + bubbling fixed**
  - `src/ui/Disclosure.tsx`: Tooltip now renders via React portal into `#dashboard-overlay` with fixed positioning and viewport clamping (horizontal clamp, vertical flip as needed). Re-measures on open; closes on scroll/resize.
  - Strict event swallowing on ⓘ (mouse, pointer, touch, key). Keyboard Enter/Space/? opens sheet. Coarse pointer click → sheet; fine pointer click → toggle tooltip.
  - Global singleton exclusivity: only one disclosure (tooltip or sheet) open at a time.
  - `data-disclosure` attribute added to the ⓘ button for ancestry-based guards.
- **Card click isolation**
  - `src/widgets/CardWidget.tsx`: Card root `onClick` ignores events if `event.defaultPrevented` or if `event.target.closest('[data-disclosure]')` matches.
- **Overlay mount**
  - `index.html`: Added `<div id="dashboard-overlay"></div>` next to `#root` for all portaled UI.
- **Build + Redeploy**
  - Local build succeeded (TypeScript + vite). Redeploy triggered to Windsurf (Netlify). Preview URL above.
- **Fixed TS error**
  - Removed event args passed into zero-arg long-press callbacks in `Disclosure.tsx` (TS2554).
- **Telemetry**
  - `disclosure` events preserved; hover/click/focus/long-press paths track `tooltip` vs `sheet` opens.

## 2) Working memory state and task flow

- **Current goal**: Run Lighthouse and axe audits on the live build; record results in `WORKLOG.md`; fix critical issues; redeploy.
- **Recent successes**
  - Mouse wheel rotation and delta normalization; capture-phase, passive:false, preventDefault().
  - Portaled disclosure, viewport clamping, event swallowing, singleton, card guards, overlay mount; clean build and redeploy.
- **Open tasks (selected)**
  - Implement idle “book cover” framing copy.
  - Hover AI bubble with rotating enterprise name-drops.
  - First-click intro modal wired to Messenger via `progressive.open`.
  - Trim micro-narratives to ≤15 words; plain-first tone.
  - Lighthouse + axe audits; document; fix issues; redeploy.
  - Introduce global compact density tokens/utilities; refactor shared card styles.
  - Update `PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md`, `README.md` with overlay/portal rationale and savepoint/handoff workflow.

## 3) Relevant project files and recent hotspots

- `src/ui/Disclosure.tsx` — unified disclosure component; portal + clamp; event swallowing; singleton exclusivity.
- `src/widgets/CardWidget.tsx` — interactive card surface; click guard against disclosure-originating events.
- `index.html` — `#root` and `#dashboard-overlay` mounts.
- `src/widgets/Operations.tsx` — Operations deck carousel; disclosure integrated in headers; wheel/touch handling; telemetry.
- `src/ui/useLongPress.ts` — long-press detection; coarse pointer helper.
- `src/glossary/registry.ts` — glossary entries for disclosure content.
- `windsurf_deployment.yaml` — saved Windsurf/Netlify project ID and framework.
- `WORKLOG.md` — record build failures/fixes, audit results, redeploy notes.

## 4) Agent assignments and roles

- **rolodexterVS (Windsurf/Cascade)** — agentic coding assistant executing code edits, builds, deployments, audits, and documentation updates.
- **Joe** — product/engineering lead providing requirements, design preferences, and final approvals.
- **rolodexterGPT** — strategic/exec documentation assistant for broader reboot prompts, stakeholder briefs, and planning narratives.

## 5) System constraints and environment

- OS: Windows; prefer PowerShell separators; avoid `cd` in commands (set `cwd`).
- Framework: Vite + React + TypeScript; `framer-motion` for motion.
- Strict linting and TypeScript settings.
- Performance targets: a11y ≥ 95, 60fps on mid-tier devices, zero console warnings; movement: transform/opacity only; fixed card height; no CLS.
- Accessibility: `role="region"`, `aria-label` on deck; reduced-motion crossfade. Disclosure a11y: `aria-haspopup`, `aria-expanded`, `aria-describedby`.
- Deployment: Windsurf (Netlify) project with saved project ID; live at `riskill-chat-overlay.windsurf.build`.

## 6) Naming conventions and telemetry

- Pages array keys: `summary | incidents | performance | forecast`.
- Telemetry/bus topics: `ops.scroll.wheel`, `ops.scroll.cycle`, `progressive.open`, `disclosure.open`.
- UI polish patterns: glassmorphism cards (`bg-slate-900/70`, backdrop-blur, inner shadow, gradient edge highlight), ghost depth layers, hover/focus scale + shadow.

## 7) Integration notes and discoveries

- Disclosure portal required overlay root; added `#dashboard-overlay` to `index.html`.
- Card click guards provide second-line defense against bubbling even if consuming control changes.
- Singleton model is reliable for current UX; consider scoped manager if simultaneous disclosures needed later.

## 8) Unresolved threads and risks

- Lighthouse + axe not yet run on current live build; results and remediations pending.
- Decide on close-on-scroll vs. dynamic reposition behavior for long content tooltips.
- Future need for multiple concurrent disclosures may call for a DisclosureManager.
- Ensure overlay presence in any alternate entry points (lint/runtime assert idea).

## 9) How to resume (next session checklist)

- Verify deployment: tooltip clamp, no double-activation, correct a11y attrs, clean console.
- Run Lighthouse and axe on: https://riskill-chat-overlay.windsurf.build
  - Record results in `WORKLOG.md`; file issues; prioritize criticals.
- Apply fixes; redeploy; ping stakeholders with preview and highlights.
- Expand unified disclosure pattern to remaining Operations faces via `src/glossary/registry.ts`.
- Update `PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md` and `README.md` with overlay/portal rationale and usage.
