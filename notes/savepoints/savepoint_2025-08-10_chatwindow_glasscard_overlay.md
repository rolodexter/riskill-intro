# Save Point Reboot Prompt — rolodexterVS x Joe

Use this prompt as the first message in a brand new session to restore full working memory and continue seamlessly.

## 1) Implementation summary and technical achievements

- Project: riskill-cinematic (Vite + React + TypeScript + Tailwind + Framer Motion)
- Repo root: `C:\Users\rolod\OneDrive\riskill-intro` (origin: `https://github.com/rolodexter/riskill-intro.git`, default branch: `main`)
- App path: `riskill-cinematic/`
- Key features implemented
  - ChatWindow overlay anchoring
    - `src/App.tsx`: Added in-grid `#dashboard-overlay` (absolute inside `<main>`, `pointer-events-none`, z-index token). Creates correct local stacking and anchor frame.
    - `src/components/chat/ChatWindow.tsx`: Portaled to overlay via `createPortal`. Absolute positioning relative to overlay with collision-aware anchoring (prefer right, flip left, fallback center-below; clamped to overlay; 16px margins). rAF-batched updates on scroll/resize/`ResizeObserver`.
    - Mobile bottom sheet for ≤640px, keyboard-safe via `visualViewport` offset and composer `pb: env(safe-area-inset-bottom)`.
  - GlassCard visual integration (frameless)
    - Removed visible border; adopted widget tokens: `bg-white/6–8`, `backdrop-blur-lg`, `ring-1 ring-white/[0.02]`, elevated shadow `0 8px 28px rgba(0,0,0,.28)`.
    - Widget paddings (`p-4 sm:p-5`) and typography (`text-sm` title with tracking, body `text-[13px] text-white/80`).
    - Shared control styles for buttons/inputs; scroller `overscroll-contain`.
  - Accessibility
    - Dialog semantics preserved, focus behaviors and ESC close. `aria-describedby` links to narrative region.
  - Performance
    - Animations limited to transform/opacity; rAF-batched layout reads/writes; no CLS observed locally; target 60fps.
- Build status
  - `npm run build` successful (~5.05s). Artifacts: CSS gzip ~8.68kB; JS gzip ~112.8kB.
- Deployment
  - Provider error using prior site ID; deployed via Windsurf as a new review site.
  - Preview URL: https://riskill-chat-overlay.windsurf.build/?revx=1 (build queued at last check). Config saved in `riskill-cinematic/windsurf_deployment.yaml`.

## 2) Strategic insights and business implications

- Worked better than expected
  - In-grid overlay anchoring improves contextual feel and Z‑stack correctness; frameless glass improves polish and coherence with widgets.
- Constraints discovered
  - Provider deploy reliability with an existing site ID was inconsistent; new review subdomain is a robust workaround.
- Opportunities enabled
  - Overlay/portal pattern and pointer-events hygiene generalize to tooltips/menus/scrims.
  - Shared control styles create a base for a widget style system.
- Items needing product decisions
  - Narrative length policy (truncate vs. scroll-first/read-more; desktop vs. mobile caps).
  - Keyboard affordances outside the card (global reopen, traversal, escape when nested).

## 3) Documentation requirements and communication needs

- Update
  - `PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md`: overlay portal rationale, pointer-events pattern, anchoring algorithm.
  - `README.md`: local dev/QA steps, reduced-motion, deployment notes (Windsurf site, SPA fallback).
  - `WORKLOG.md`: append Lighthouse/axe results and redeploy notes.
- Produce
  - A11y overlay checklist; integration guide for passing `anchorRect`; visual tokens (glass/rings/shadows/z‑tiers) mapping to Tailwind.
- Process
  - Add scripts/CI for Lighthouse + axe reporting.

## 4) Stakeholder context and feedback integration

- Design: approved frameless glass and widget parity.
- Product: approved chat integration approach; outstanding policy decisions listed above.
- QA: manual pass on desktop/mobile and reduced motion; automated audits pending.
- Deployment: new Windsurf review site created; site can be claimed in Netlify from the deploy step UI to access logs.
- Communication: proactive preview notifications requested and followed.

## 5) Strategic guidance requests and next priorities

- Decisions needed
  - Narrative length policy; keyboard affordances outside cards; consolidate deploy back to original site ID vs. keep review subdomain.
- Immediate next steps
  - Run Lighthouse + axe on live build; address critical issues; document results.
  - Refine anchoring heuristics for edge cases; consider transform-only placement updates.
  - Tokenize z-index tiers/surface tokens; align micro-viz chrome across KPI cards.
  - Update README/PROJECT_STRUCTURE; append WORKLOG with audit results; prepare demo script.

## Agent roles & operating protocols

- Agents
  - rolodexterVS (Windsurf/Cascade): engineering execution (code, QA, deploy, docs), proactive previews.
  - Joe: product/design/stakeholder; reviews, decisions, approvals.
- Environment & constraints
  - OS: Windows. Shell: PowerShell; prefer `;` chaining; avoid Unix `&&`.
  - Dev server: Vite (default 5178). Prior runs used 5180.
  - Motion: transform/opacity only; respect reduced-motion; no CLS; maintain 60fps.
  - Pointer-events model for overlays: root overlay `pointer-events-none`, interactive subtree `pointer-events-auto`.
  - A11y: roles, focus trap, ESC, descriptive labelling.
- Naming conventions
  - Overlay id: `#dashboard-overlay` within `<main>`.
  - Query flag for preview states: `?revx=1`.
  - Tailwind tokens: see `tailwind.config.js` (glass, edge, accent, text colors; backdropBlur.xs; opacity.6/.15). Surfaces prefer `bg-white/6–8`, `ring-white/[0.02]`.

## How to resume this work (prompt to paste as first message)

"""
You are rolodexterVS (Windsurf/Cascade). Restore the riskill-cinematic session using this Save Point. Continue with the immediate next steps:
- Check the Windsurf deploy at https://riskill-chat-overlay.windsurf.build/?revx=1 and confirm it is live.
- Run Lighthouse and axe; record results in WORKLOG; fix critical issues; redeploy.
- Propose decisions for narrative length policy and keyboard affordances outside cards.
- Prepare a short demo script highlighting chat overlay anchoring and frameless GlassCard parity.
Context:
- Repo: C:\Users\rolod\OneDrive\riskill-intro, app: riskill-cinematic
- Files of interest: src/App.tsx, src/components/chat/ChatWindow.tsx, netlify.toml, windsurf_deployment.yaml, WORKLOG.md
- Constraints: Windows+PowerShell, transform/opacity-only motion, reduced-motion, a11y, pointer-events overlay pattern.
